#Features So Far

* Day by Day job reports *_What was Running and When_*

:shit:

    Move days up and down with arrow keys or vim keys.

* Realtime view of Running and Submitted app flow.

`/apps`

* Unused Apps List *_Private apps are not included_*

`/components`

* Graph of all apps rant *_Data represents Completed apps only_*

`/graph`

## TODO

:black_square: The list of unused apps should have a link to the wiki page for
them or do a search on the forums if no wiki link has been provided.

:black_square: Get detailed info about a certain day on graph bubble click.

## NOTE

Everything is subject to change.
